## Overview
### Description
ReClaim is a web-app that was created for users that want to reduce waste and help the earth!
This app provides its users with a marketplace and gives them the ability to easily find recyclables near them.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Market Place
- **Mobile:** This app would be ideally developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Since it is a market place type of app the desired functionality would allow for better usage on mobile devices.
- **Story:** Create an app that allows people to create a post containing batches/bundles of recyclables available for those who may want it in a seamless manner.

- **Market:** Environmentalists/people who could use passive income/people who want to actively make this a side/full-time hustle. Those who care about recycling in general.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or often as the user wanted. It depends on whether or not the users (Providers) do actually recycle and collectors are interested in collecting those recycled goods.
- **Scope:** First we would start with a simple marketplace where Providers post their batch, and collectors simply claim and pick up. Then, as the amount of users grows we would need to implement better systems to prevent others from picking up batches that are already claimed. This would be text/notification systems that allows for you to claim a batch, while allowing others to be placed in queue in case that batch is canceled (think Uber, Instacart, etc..). Even bigger, could be pairing up with organizations to create a reward system to entice everyone to recycle more and do it long term.
